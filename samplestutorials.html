        <h3><b>Tutorial: Initialize your first keyboard!</b></h3>
        To start using the Play section, you will first need 
        to pick a scale to initialize from the scales listed 
        in the Scale List section. 
        There, you will find the names of the scales as used in the Play section, a brief description, and how many pitches there are in the scale.
        <br>
        Once you have picked the scale, note down the name and head to the Play section. Please note that once 
        you are in the Play section, <b>the keyboard will automatically disappear when you change from page to page. </b>
        As such, please make sure you know the name of the scale so you don't risk having to go back and forth between the pages.
        <br>
        Once you have picked a scale, you need to pick a <b>root frequency.</b> To know what a root frequency is, 
        please head to the History and Theory section. 
        <br>
        Finally, pick a synth from the options given. A synth will essentially determine what your keyboard is going to sound like.
        <br>
        Now you have everything! Input your scale, root frequency, and synth, then press the "Save" button. The keybord will appear on the screen.
        The gain (or volume) of the sound output can be controlled with the slider over the upper left corner of the keyboard. 

        <b> NOTE: If you want to change any of these setting, simpy change the input in the appropriate space and click "Save" again. The keyboard will be updated. </b>

        <h3><b>Tutorial: Recording a piece!</b></h3>
        To record a small tune, you can first click the button to the right of the volume slider (the circle one), then play your tune!
        <br>
        To stop recording, click the square button. 
        <br>
        Once you have done that, the recording will save and you will be prompted to enter a 
        name for your clip. A player will appear next to the recording buttons, which will allow you to play abck your recording.
        If you are happy with the recording, click the link to the right of the player to download the clip.
        The clip will be in WAV format, which is the only format currently available. 
        <h3><b> About key mappings</b></h3>
        The mappings from digital keyboard to laptop keyboard exist and work, but they are not fully complete for synths with more than 50 keys. 
        Soon, it will be updated for all synths.
