            The following material comes from my thesis report (Naselli, 2025).

            <h3><b>Microtonality: an introduction</b></h3>
            <br>
            Although the topic of microtonality is much too wide to cover fully within this overview, 
            a brief and comprehensive history and explanation can be found in Harry Partchâ€™s Genesis of a Music 
            (1949).
            For the scope of this report, it suffices to say that microtonality comprehends any tuning or temperaments system that 
            goes beyond the 12 semitone division of an octave (equal temperament) that is overwhelmingly popular in Western music
             (Partch, 1949). Furthermore, any musical system which has evolved independently to the Western musical systems 
             can also be considered microtonal if we accept the concept as a frame of reference to understand them. 
             It is, however, important to note the inherent worth of each musical system in their own right, 
             as well as the significance of the socio-cultural conditions amongst which they emerged. 
             A classification as microtonal is only useful in this case in order to set them apart from the standard Western equal temperament.
            

            <h3><b>Equal temperament and microtonality</b></h3>
            <br>
            The equal temperament is built upon a system of semitones, which are sub-unit divisions of one octave. 
            As mentioned above, within the equal temperament, as well as within most musical systems that emerged in 
            Western Europe from Medieval times onward, there are 12 semitones.  
            Microtonal music encompasses all musical systems which contain a different subdivision of the octave. 
            As such, a tuning with 5 subdivisions or a tuning with 118 subdivisions both fall under the purview of microtonality. 
            Such sub-units are called microtones, since they are smaller, or bigger, than the equal temperament semitone.
